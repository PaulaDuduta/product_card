# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This was my first challenge to make on Frontend Mentor and represented a product preview card for a perfume for two resolutions (desktop and mobile devices). For my project implementation I've used Next.js framweork and Netlify to publish it online (https://fantastic-daifuku-163de3.netlify.app).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements (Add to cart button, which change it's color when the user hovers over it).
